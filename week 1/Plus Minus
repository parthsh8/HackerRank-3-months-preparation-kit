Given an array of integers, calculate the ratios of its elements that are positive, negative, and zero. Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line with 6 places after the decimal.


def plusMinus(arr):
    # Write your code here
    n = len(arr)
    countzero = 0
    countpos = 0
    countneg = 0
    for i in arr:
        if i < 0:
            countneg += 1
        elif i == 0:
            countzero += 1
        if i > 0:
            countpos += 1
    print(countpos/n) 
    print(countneg/n)
    print(countzero/n)
